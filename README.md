FARFAR
======

Fully Automated Robotic Fika Announcer and Reminder

## Usage

FARFAR listens for messages in both the #random channel and on direct messages. You can get his attention in the following ways:

 * Send a direct message in private, e.g.: `when is the next fika?`
 * Inside the #random channel by direct mention, e.g.: `@farfar when is the next fika?`

This works for all commands.

### Supported commands

FARFAR is really versatile and will try to help you with (almost) everything you need, just like a real farfar!

#### Fika related commands

#### Member management commands

#### Date blacklisting commands

#### Fun commands
