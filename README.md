FARFAR

**Fully Automated Robotic Fika Announcer and Reminder**

FARFAR is a Slack bot which periodically sends out reminders about this weeks fika to a set of Slack users. Each week a new person is responsible for this week's fika, in a round-robin fashion.

## Usage

FARFAR listens for messages in both the #general channel and on direct messages. You can get his attention in the following ways:

 * Send a direct message in private, e.g.: `when is the next fika?`
 * Inside the #general channel by direct mention, e.g.: `@farfar when is the next fika?`

This works for all commands.

### Supported commands

FARFAR is really versatile and will try to help you with (almost) everything you need, just like a real farfar!

#### Automatically-triggered actions
FARFAR will periodically send out announcements to a public channel to remind everyone about the upcoming fikas. The default schedule is like this, assuming Thursday is the fika-day.

 * **Sunday:** A message will be sent out about the next week's upcoming fika, and who is responsible.
 * **Thursday at 10:00:** A message will be sent out to remind everyone that later today is fika.
 * **Thursday at 14:57:** A message will be sent out to remind everyone that fika starts at 15:00.

In addition to this, there are also two notifications sent only to person responsible for this week's fika. These notifications are sent both as a direct message in Slack, and as an e-mail to the e-mail address registered to the Slack account of the person.

 * **Sunday:** A message to remind you that you are responsible for fika this week.
 * **Thursday at 10:00:** A message to remind you that you are responsible for fika today.

#### Fika related commands

 * `fika/next/n√§sta`: If any of these words are mentioned FARFAR will respond with the next fika date, and the person responsible.

#### Member management commands

 * `add @slackuser`: Add a new member to the fika group. The initial position will be last in the fika queue.
 * `remove @slackuser`: Remove someone from the fika group.
 * `list`: List all members of the fika group. They are listed in next-fika order.
 * `move @slackuser 2`: Move user from its current position in the list to position 2 (in this case). Can be used to reorder the list.

#### Date blacklisting commands

 * `blacklist 2016-10-17`: Add the given date to the blacklist, so no fika will be served that day.
 * `whitelist 2016-10-17`: Remove the given date from the blacklist.
 * `blacklist`: List all dates in the blacklist.

#### Fun commands
You have the source code. Go get 'em :wink:

## Installation, configuration, and running

Like a real farfar, FARFAR does not want to bother you, just be of help whenever you need it. Therefore, he is easy to configure.

### Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/zozs/farfar.git
$ npm install
```

### Configuration

Preferably, copy `config/default.json` to `config/local.json` and perform configuration in that file. You will have to modify at least the `token` setting.

The configuration file has the following properties:

 * `token`: The token for the bot as added to your team.
 * `storageDirectory`: The directory to store configuration data in.
 * `storageKey`: The username of the bot, used when storing configuration data.
 * `fikaDay`: The day fika is served. Default is `4` which is Thursday.
 * `announceChannel`: The channel to send public fika announcements to.
 * `nodemailerTransport`: SMTP server to use for sending e-mails. See documentation for Nodemailer for further information.

### Running

Just launch the `index.js` file. You may want to use `nodemon` as well, since it is included as a dependency, if so, simply run `npm start`.
